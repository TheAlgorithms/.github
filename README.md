## Introduction
Default files for [@TheAlgorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms) repositories.

GitHub will use and display default files for any public repository in [@TheAlgorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms) organization that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

- the root of the repository
- the `.github` folder
- the `docs` folder

For example, anyone who creates an issue or pull request in a public repository that does not have its own CONTRIBUTING file will see a link to the default CONTRIBUTING file.

The files are not included in `clones`, `packages`, or `downloads` of individual repositories because they are stored only in the `.github` repository.

## Supported file types
The default file types supported by GitHub are as follows:

- [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project): A CODE_OF_CONDUCT file defines standards for how to engage in a community.
- [`CONTRIBUTING`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors): A CONTRIBUTING file communicates how people should contribute to your project.
- [`FUNDING`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository): A FUNDING file displays a sponsor button in your repository to increase the visibility of funding options for your open source project. 
- [`Issue and pull request templates`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates): Issue and pull request templates customize and standardize the information you'd like contributors to include when they open issues and pull requests in your repository. 
- [`SECURITY`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository): 	A SECURITY file gives instructions for how to responsibly report a security vulnerability in your project.
- [`SUPPORT`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-support-resources-to-your-project): A SUPPORT file lets people know about ways to get help with your project.

Note: License files must be added to individual repositories so the file will be included when a project is cloned, packaged, or downloaded.
